# Load balancer
Project done during **Full Stack Software Engineering studies** at **ALX School**. It aims to learn about the roles of load balancer and improve our web stack so that there is redundancy for our web servers. This will allow us to be able to accept more traffic by doubling the number of web servers, and to make our infrastructure more reliable.

## Technologies
* Scripts written in Bash 4.3.11(1)
